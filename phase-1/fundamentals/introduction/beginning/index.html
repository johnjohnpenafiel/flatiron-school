  Core Deliverables
  1. Write a preamble that lets the browser know that this document's type is HTML.
  2. Write a <head> and <body>.
  3. Link this file to `index.js`, so that the browser loads that file **after** loading the <body>.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
  <meta lang="en" /> <!-- we are using the <meta/> element to tell the browser our chosen language is English -->
  <title>MY NEW WEBSITE</title>
  <script defer src="./index.js"></script>

</head>
<body>
  <article>
    <h1>Website Title Here</h1>
    <address> by John John Penafiel</address>
  </article>
</body>
